<h2> About this project: </h2>

This repository is my project for the [Applied Linear Algebra to Machine Learning Course at Platzi](https://platzi.com/clases/algebra-ml/)

As well, this is one of the challenges for Platzi Master -- an education acceleration program to form the future tech leaders in LATAM.

<h2> Brief description : </h2>

In these notebooks, we focus on matrix decomposition for dimensional manipulation. The implications of such functions are relevant to processing optimization in machine and deep learning.
